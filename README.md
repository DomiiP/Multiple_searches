### How to use it?
There are three python programs you can use and a chrome extension.
##### How to open python program
Open cmd > change directory to downloaded folder location > type _python script-name.py_
##### How to upload a chrome extension
More Tools > Extensions > Enable developer mode > Load unpacked > Select _Website_ folder

### My TODO steps:
1. Simple command program for multiple searches - [x]
2. Simple GUI program for multiple searches - [x]
3. Implemented everything onto a website (Chrome extension) - [x]

###  How you can help:

* Recursive function on the website can be altered
* _window.open_ function doesn't open multiple tabs commonly
